This is a pomodoro timer that is a little tweaked for all the potterheads out there!


    * I used React JavaScript library to make a single page application that allows you to be more productive. 
    * It has an integrated todo list to keep track of your progress.
    * For the user authentication and other backend related operations, I used Firebase.
    * As far as the state management is concerned, I used Context API.
    * The styling of the app has been done using Tailwind CSS, and the icons have been used from the library called react-icons.
